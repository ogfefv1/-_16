    <h1>WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?</h1>
    <p>
        LOREM IPSUM IS SIMPLY DUMMY TEXT OF THE PRINTING AND TYPESETTING INDUSTRY. LOREM IPSUM HAS 
        <p>
            BEEN THE INDUSTRY'S STANDARD DUMMY TEXT EVER SINCE THE 1500S, WHEN AN UNKNOWN PRINTER

    <h1>WHY DO WE USE IT?</h1>
    <p>
        IT IS A LONG ESTABLISHED FACT THAT A READER WILL BE DISTRACTED BY THE READABLE CONTENT OF A 
        <p>
            PAGE WHEN LOOKING AT ITS LAYOUT. THE POINT OF USING LOREM IPSUM IS THAT IT HAS A MORE-OR-LESS

        <p>
            LOREM IPSUM AS THEIR DEFAULT MODEL TEXT, AND A SEARCH FOR 'LOREM IPSUM' WILL UNCOVER MANY
        </p>   
        <p>
            WEB SITES STILL IN THEIR INFANCY. VARIOUS VERSIONS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS, SOMETIMES BY
